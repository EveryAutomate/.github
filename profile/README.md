## What is Bleufi?

**Bleufi is a startup validation platform** that helps founders:
- ✅ Validate product-market fit before building
- ✅ Test business ideas with real user feedback
- ✅ Design user-centered products using Jobs-to-be-Done framework
- ✅ Generate functional prototypes and MVPs quickly
- ✅ Monitor performance and iterate based on data

According to Y Combinator, **8 out of 10 startups fail because they never achieve product-market fit**. Bleufi solves this by helping you validate early, build smart, and scale with confidence.
